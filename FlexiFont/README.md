## **Installation**

To integrate [Your Utility Name] into your project, simply include it in your CSS.

1. **Download or Copy the Code**:
   - Copy the provided CSS and paste it into your project’s stylesheet.
   - Alternatively, if you're using a package manager or a build system (e.g., npm or webpack), you can import the CSS directly.

   ```css
   /* Example import */
   @import 'your-utility-name.css';
   ```

2. **Use it in your CSS**:
   You can now apply the utility to any text element in your CSS.

   ```css
   .responsive-text {
     font-size: clamp(14px, calc(14px + (100vw - 400px) / 400), 24px);
   }
   ```

---

## **Usage**

The core of the utility is based on the **CSS `clamp()` function**, which allows you to set a **minimum**, **preferred**, and **maximum** font size that automatically adjusts based on the viewport width.

### Basic Usage

```css
.responsive-text {
  font-size: clamp(14px, 5vw, 24px);
}
```

In this example:
- The **minimum font size** is `14px`.
- The **preferred size** is calculated as `5vw`, or 5% of the viewport width.
- The **maximum font size** is `24px`.

### Customizing Font Size

You can change the values based on your design’s needs. For example, for headings or larger text:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(24px, 8vw, 48px);
}
```

---

## **Options & Configuration**

You can customize the utility to suit your design system. The primary configuration options are:

- **Minimum Font Size** (`14px` by default)
- **Preferred Font Size** (`5vw` by default)
- **Maximum Font Size** (`24px` by default)

Simply adjust the values in the `clamp()` function as per your requirements.

```css
/* Customize for paragraph text */
p {
  font-size: clamp(12px, 4vw, 18px);
}
```

---

## **Examples**

Here are some examples of how [Your Utility Name] can be used in different contexts.

### Example 1: Body Text

```css
body {
  font-size: clamp(14px, 5vw, 22px);
}
```

This will ensure that the body text remains readable on all devices, scaling smoothly between `14px` and `22px`.

### Example 2: Headings

```css
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(24px, 8vw, 48px);
}
h2 {
  font-size: clamp(20px, 6vw, 40px);
}
```

This ensures that headings scale appropriately with screen size, maintaining visual hierarchy without manual adjustments.

### Example 3: Button Text

```css
button {
  font-size: clamp(16px, 3vw, 20px);
}
```

This adjusts the button text to fit various screen sizes while ensuring it's always legible and consistent.
